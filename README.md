## What is amqp?

**Answer:** AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. It is a widely-used protocol for messaging between applications, especially in distributed systems. AMQP provides features like reliable message delivery, message queuing, publish/subscribe patterns, and routing. It is commonly used with message brokers like RabbitMQ to enable communication between different components of a system without them needing to know each other's internal logic.


## What does it mean? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first guest, and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for? 

**Answer:** The string `guest:guest@localhost:5672` is a connection string used to connect to an AMQP server, typically RabbitMQ. In this format, the first guest refers to the username, and the second guest refers to the password. These are the default credentials provided by RabbitMQ for local development purposes. The term localhost indicates that the AMQP server is running on the local machine, while 5672 is the default port used by RabbitMQ to accept AMQP protocol connections. So essentially, this string tells the client to connect to a RabbitMQ server on the same machine using the guest user credentials over port 5672.
